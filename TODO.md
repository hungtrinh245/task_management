# TODO List for UI Fixes

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Make Sidebar responsive with hamburger menu for mobile
- [x] Update MainLayout for responsive padding and margins
- [x] Make TaskListPage responsive with horizontal scroll and flexible layouts

## Summary

The UI has been improved to be responsive and no longer covers the entire screen inappropriately. The sidebar now collapses on mobile with a hamburger menu, and the main content adjusts padding accordingly. The task list table is now scrollable on small screens and has responsive button sizes.
